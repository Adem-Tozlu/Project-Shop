# Project – Shop

As part of a further education course at DCI, I designed and developed an online shop as a React Single-Page Application (SPA). This project was successfully presented as part of the final exam in the frontend area.

This is a shop that is implemented as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using React and various hooks such as useState, useEffect, useNavigate, and useContext.
